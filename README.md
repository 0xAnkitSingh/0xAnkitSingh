## 👨‍💻 About Me

Currently architecting the future of AI at **Siemens** in Bangalore, where I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world industrial applications. With a strong foundation in Computer Science from **NIT Meghalaya**, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

```python
class AIEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Your Name"
        self.role = "AI Engineer @ Siemens"
        self.location = "Bangalore, India 🇮🇳"
        self.education = "B.Tech CSE - NIT Meghalaya"
        self.passion = ["GenAI", "LLMs", "Multi-Agent Systems"]
        
    def current_focus(self):
        return [
            "🧠 Generative AI Applications",
            "🤖 Large Language Model Engineering", 
            "🔄 Multi-Agentic System Architecture",
            "⚙️ Industrial AI Solutions"
        ]
        
    def daily_routine(self):
        return "Build → Test → Deploy → Innovate → Repeat"
```
